Includes:<br>
      <ul style = ""list-style-type:square;font-size:13px"">
        <li>Statistical techniques using Python to test the relationship between 'food pinching performance' (i.e. the ability to place peanuts in a cup) and chopstick length.</li>
        <li>Statistical techniques using Python to investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology known as the Stroop Effect. Python code was used to produce descriptive statistics, data visualizations and run a paired samples t-test.</li>
        <li>Application of data wrangling, statistical analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques to a New York City Subway dataset. Includes a Mann-Whitney U-test to test for significant difference between the number of people who ride the NYC subway when raining versus not raining, while a regression model was fitted to predict the hourly number of Subway entries.</li>
        <li>Data munging techniques using Python in order to clean OpenStreetMap data for Perth, Australia, create a .json map file, and load that file into the MongoDB instance.</li>
        <li>Exploratory analysis in R in order to examine the relationship between 11 chemical and physical properties of a sample of white wines. Includes univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis using the ggplot function, with a focus on identifying properties which are correlated with the subjective quality ranking of each wine.</li>
        <li>A Python based predictive model which is able to identify and label Persons of Interest (POI) i.e. Enron employees who committed fraud. Makes use of a GridSearchCV Pipeline with a StratifiedShuffleSplit cross-validation loop to select the optimal estimation algorithm (logistic regression estimator with feature scaling using MinMaxScaling and feature selection with SelectKBest).</li>
        <li>An interactive data visualization from a dataset of flight delay statistics for airports based within the U.S., created using HTML, CSS, D3.js and dimple charts. Visualization indented to provide users the ability to easily access and interpret time-series flight delay statistics for various airports spread across the U.S..</li>
        <li>Results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity in order to recommend whether or not to launch a change to the Udacity course enrolment webpage. Involved the selection of invariant and evaluation metrics, calculation of the duration and proportion of traffic diversion, and analysis of whether a statistically significant result was observed between the test and control groups.</li>
