<p>A number of projects which focus on how to, 1) wrangle, extract, transform, and load data from various databases, formats, and data sources; 2) use exploratory data analysis techniques to identify meaningful relationships, patterns, or trends from complex data sets; 3) classify and predict into the future with applied statistics and machine learning algorithms; and 4) communicate data analysis and findings through effective data visualizations.</p>
<p>Includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Statistical techniques using Python to test the relationship between 'food pinching performance' (i.e. the ability to place peanuts in a cup) and chopstick length.</li>
<li>Statistical techniques using Python to investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology known as the Stroop Effect. Python code was used to produce descriptive statistics, data visualizations and run a paired samples t-test.</li>
<li>Application of data wrangling, statistical analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques to a New York City Subway dataset. Includes a Mann-Whitney U-test to test for significant difference between the number of people who ride the NYC subway when raining versus not raining, while a regression model was fitted to predict the hourly number of Subway entries.</li>
<li>Data munging techniques using Python in order to clean OpenStreetMap data for Perth, Australia, create a .json map file, and load that file into the MongoDB instance.</li>
<li>Exploratory analysis in R in order to examine the relationship between 11 chemical and physical properties of a sample of white wines. Includes univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis using the ggplot function, with a focus on identifying properties which are correlated with the subjective quality ranking of each wine.</li>
<li>A Python based predictive model which is able to identify and label Persons of Interest (POI) i.e. Enron employees who committed fraud. Makes use of a GridSearchCV Pipeline with a StratifiedShuffleSplit cross-validation loop to select the optimal estimation algorithm (logistic regression estimator with feature scaling using MinMaxScaling and feature selection with SelectKBest).</li>
<li>An interactive data visualization from a dataset of flight delay statistics for airports based within the US, created using HTML, CSS, D3.js and dimple charts. Visualization indented to provide users the ability to easily access and interpret time-series flight delay statistics for various airports spread across the US.</li>
<li>Results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity in order to recommend whether or not to launch a change to the Udacity course enrolment webpage. Involved the selection of invariant and evaluation metrics, calculation of the duration and proportion of traffic diversion, and analysis of whether a statistically significant result was observed between the test and control groups.</li>

<p>A number of projects which focus on 1) understanding the dataset and application for which a machine learning algorithm could be applied, 2) how to select an optimal machine learning algorithm depending on the application, 3) how to use a range of validation metrics in order to assess potential algorithms.</p>
<p>Includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented a DecisionTreeRegression based prediction model using Python in order to predict house prices within the Boston area. Includes a GridSearchCV method for parameter optimization and an assessment of the model over a number of validation metrics.</li>
<li>Assessed and implemented three prediction models (DecisionTreeClassifier, SVC and KNeighborsClassifier) using Python in order to classify students which are likely to fail. Includes an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of each of these classifiers, over aspects such as complexity, efficiency and suitability to datasets. A GridSearchCV method was used for parameter optimization and bootstrap techniques to assess to optimal sample size based on various validation metrics.</li>
<li>Applied dimensionality reduction and classification techniques using Python, to a set of sales data from a wholesale grocery distributor, in order to categorize its customers into segments. Includes the use of dimensionality reduction techniques using Principle Component Analysis and Independent Component Analysis, as well as the application of KMeans clusters in order to segment the dimensionality reduced data.</li>
<li>Designed an Artificial Intelligence driving agent for a Smartcab, so that it may successfully complete a trip between two waypoints. Involved the use of a Q-Learning algorithm/ matrix which the agent is able to update according to a predefined reward metric.</li>
<li>Conducted exploratory analysis on data from the MotoGP 2014 season, and built a model which predicts the winning rider.
