   starter code for exploring the Enron dataset (emails + finances)

   the dataset has the form
   enron_data["LASTNAME FIRSTNAME MIDDLEINITIAL"] = { features_dict }

   {features_dict} is a dictionary of features associated with that person
   you should explore features_dict as part of the mini-project,
