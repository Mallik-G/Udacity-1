<p>Assessed and implemented three prediction models (DecisionTreeClassifier, SVC and KNeighborsClassifier) using Python in order to classify students which are likely to fail. Includes an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of each of these classifiers, over aspects such as complexity, efficiency and suitability to datasets. A GridSearchCV method was used for parameter optimization and bootstrap techniques to assess to optimal sample size based on various validation metrics.</p>
